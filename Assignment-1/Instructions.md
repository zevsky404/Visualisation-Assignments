## Visualization Design

In the last weeks, you learned a lot about the
- what (what kind of data is it?)
- why (which tasks do you want to perform on the data?)
- how (how to encode data with marks & channels, how to manipulate, facet and reduce your data)

In this assignment, you will put these skills to use to create your own visualization design.

When you are finished, zip this whole folder (all given files + your sketches) and upload the zip file to the Moodle platform.
If you have questions regarding the tasks, please use the forums on Moodle, such that all students can benefit from the answer.

Don't forget to run `npm init` and `npm install` to enable you to get an overview of the dataset.

## Task 1: The What (25%)
Determine the dataset type of the given data (contents of the 2018_Central_Park_Squirrel_Census.csv), the attribute types (categorical, ordinal, quantitative) as well as their ranges / possible attribute values for 5 of the attributes.
Write your answer in the file "what.md".

## Task 2: The Why (25%)
Think of two questions from the view of a biologist regarding the population or spread of fur colors of the squirrels provided in the data.
Please formulate the questions that are complex enough to benefit from visual analysis.
Analyze the type of task within the why of the what-why-how framework (Lecture 1: Slides 42 - 47), by determining at least one target - action pair for each question.
Write your questions as well as the answer in the file "why.md".

##  Task 3: The How (50%)
Design (not implement) a system of interlinked visualizations that are able to answer the questions posed in Task 2. Draw a sketch either by hand (and scan / photograph it) or with a graphics program and evaluate it critically.
Put your drawing / sketch as image into this folder.

Determine the marks, channels used, as well as sensible interactions of manipulation, facetting or reducing the data that would help towards the set task.
Write your answer in the file "how.md".
