            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <div>
                <p>It is time to show case your Javascript skills with <b>d3.js</b>! In this assignment you will apply
                    your knowledge from the previous assignment about visual encoding. You will also be required to
                    implement, using d3.js, two well-known multi-attributes visualization techniques, namely <b>the
                        scatter plot matrix</b> and <b>the parallel coordinates</b> which have been introduted in the
                    lecture. <b>Brushing</b> technique will be used to interact with the data. Optionally, you can also
                    implement <b>linking</b> to show the brushed data simultaneously on both plots.
                    Overall, your tasks are:
                <ol>
                    <li>Load and filter the dataset </li>
                    <li>Decide on 3 numerical attributes and 1 categorical attributes from the given dataset you
                        would to display!</li>
                    <li>Create the attribute labels.</li>
                    <li>Create the scatter plot matrix of those 4 attributes with the brushing technique </li>
                    <li>Create the parallel coordinates plot of those 4 attributes with the brushing technique</li>
                    <li><i>Optional, link both plots with the brush together</i></li>

                </ol>
                For this exercise, all your solution must be implemented by yourself in <b>index.js</b> script. Your
                solution will appear under <i>div#visualization</i> element in the <b>index.html</b>.

                <h3>Task 1: Prepare your data (10%)</h3>
                <p>
                    To start, you have to prepare your data and label before implementing the visualization technique.
                    In the global scope of the <b>index.js</b> you are tasked with:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Loading and filtering the dataset.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Defining your 3 numerical and 1 categorical attributes
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Defining the color mapping/scheme you are using for labeling your data points and lines in both
                        plots
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <i>Hint: Take a quick look into the dataset and decide what kind of information that
                    you want to convey with both the Scatter Plot Matrix and the Parallel Coordinates! Filtering
                    the dataset is useful to avoid cluttering and elminate irrelevant data. Regarding coloration,
                    take a look at <a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-scaleordinal"
                        id="codearea">d3.scaleOrdinal</a>.</i>

                <h3>Task 2: Create colored label (10%)</h3>
                <p>
                    Before visualizing the dataset in each plots, it is often beneficial to
                    encode the attributes and show first the labels to convey identity or magnitude of
                    the data. In this function you need to make a consistent color labelling, so that
                    viewers can associate which data to which color within and across multiple plots. Implement your
                    label in <span id="codearea"> createLabel()</span> function!
                </p>

                <i>
                    <p>
                        Hints: Use the color mapping/scheme you defined before to serve as the visual channel for the
                        label. You are free to decide which marks you are using for this. Depending on the
                        attribute you want to encode here, text label might be useful.

                <h3>Task 3: Create the scatter plot matrix for each numerical attributes pair (35%)
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In a scatter plot matrix, each attribute is assigned to one column
                    and one row of a matrix such that each cell contains a combination
                    of two attributes that are then depicted by a scatter plot. A helper function <span
                        id="codearea">createScatterPlotMatrix</span> function is provided to create 3 x 3 matrix space
                    for scatter plots for each pair of numerical attributes. You are required to
                    express the pairwise combination attribute value of the data on each cell.
                    In this task, you need to:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Show the points for all the data accordingly
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create the axes with sufficient ticks
                    </li>
                </ol>
                Write your implementation in the <span id="codearea"> scatterPlot </span> function! You are free to
                take ideas from web examples, but we require you to write your own code.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Hints: You might encounter some data that are not properly read/loaded due to mistakes in the
                        dataset
                        itself. For this, you might need to use <a
                            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseFloat?retiredLocale=de"
                            id="codearea">parseFloat</a> so that all numerical attribute values is
                        guaranteed to be stored as floats. All the data exist in the different cells so make sure to
                        scale the attributes value according the axes and transform their position to the correct place!

                <h3>
                    Task 4: Create horizontal parallel coordinates (35%)
                </h3>

                <p>

                    Realize the parallel coordinate plot with the same attributes as the
                    scatter plot matrix. In contrast to scatter plot matrixes, in a parallel coordinates plot
                    each attribute is represented by a single axis parallel to all others
                    and each data item shows as a polyline instead of a point.
                    You are expected to
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Show the vertical axes next after the other horizontally
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Label the axes and show the ticks
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Produces connected lines for all data
                    </li>
                </ol>
                Use the same color scheme as the previous task.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        Hints:
                        To implement the parallel coordinates plot, you will need a storage (for example a
                        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map"
                            id="codearea">map</a>)
                        to hold your scales for each axis. The usage of an JavaScript
                        object is not recommended here, since it is not iterable and,
                        therefore, cannot be used to create the axes with the usual
                        join pattern.
                        Another useful tool, provided by d3 is the
                        <a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-line" id="codearea">d3.line</a> function,
                        that -- given an array of <span id="codearea">[x,y]</span> values -- creates a string for an
                        SVG (cor canvas) path, that can then be used inside a SVG path element's
                        <b>d</b> attribute. Same as previous task, if you encounter problem with the data value due to
                        conversion problem <span id="codearea">parseFloat</span> might help.

                        The example of a brush within a single scatter plot has already
                        given you some hints as to how a d3.brush can be used. Other examples
                        in various contexts can be found

                <p>To benefit more from both views and
                    better understand how a scatter plot would translate into parallel coordinates and
                    the other way around, linking selections of both visualizations
                    is essential. Here you are to connect the scatter plots within the scatter plot matrix
                    and the parallel coordinates and modify the <span id="codearea">brushed</span> function,
                    such that selected data in the PCP will be reflected onto
                    the all the plots of the scatter plot matrix and vise versa.
