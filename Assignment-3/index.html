        <h3>Time Series</h3>
        <p>
            You have seen several techniques for visualizing time series data in the lecture.
            In this assignment, we're going to visualize box office data of a few movies with a line chart.
        </p>
        <p>
            The box office data is loaded from the <span class="monospace">boxoffice.csv</span>.
            Each line contains performance indicators such as <i>gross</i> and <i>totalGross</i> of one day for a
            certain movie.
            While there is a date attribute, we are going to work with the day attribute which is the number of days
            since the release.
            This allows to compare movies that were released on different dates and makes it a bit easier to handle the
            data.
            The data that is loaded from the CSV has to be grouped by title which is already done in the <span
                class="monospace">linechart.js</span>.
            The grouped data is also printed to the console, so you can inspect its structure there.
        </p>

                <h3>Task 1: Line Chart (50%)</h3>
                <p>
                    Complete the <span class="monospace">linechart.js</span> to actually draw a line chart of the box
                    office data with the <span class="monospace">day</span> for x and the <span
                        class="monospace">totalGross</span> for y.
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Define <span class="monospace">attributeX</span> and <span class="monospace">attributeY</span>
                        to be the attributes of the boxoffice data that should be used
                        to fulfill the task above.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create the scales for the x and y axis. The both x and y axis should be linearly scaled with
                        appropriate domains and ranges according to <span class="monospace">attributeX</span> and <span
                            class="monospace">attributeY</span> of the boxoffice data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Draw the axis with text label.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Draw the line for each movie with distinguishable color scheme.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add labels for each line to the right of the plot at the last position of the line.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hint:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        You can use <span class="monospace">shortenText</span> to cut
                        off long movie titles; the function is already imported from the <span
                            class="monospace">utils.js</span> in the src folder.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <span class="monospace">totalGross</span> attribute is a long string. Therefore, to use it
                        for labelling the axis tick marks, you need to use the <span
                            class="monospace">bigMoneyFormat</span> function from the <span
                            class="monospace">utils.js</span> file with the <span class="monospace"> <a
                                href="https://github.com/d3/d3-axis"></a>tickFormat</span> .
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can use <span class="monospace"><a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#lines">d3.line</a>
                        </span> to create a line generator. The <span class="monospace">x()</span> function takes the
                        scaled value of the <span class="monospace">attributeX</span> and the <span
                            class="monospace">y()</span> function
                        takes the scaled value of the <span class="monospace">attributeY</span> of each movie data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Drawing the lines means you have to add them as path elements to the <span
                            class="monospace">series</span> variable.
                    </li>

                <h3>Optional Task: Add Brushing to Line Chart (25%)</h3>
                <p>
                    Add brushing to the line chart to allow selecting a certain time range.
                    The selected time range should be used to find the (estimated) change of <span
                        class="monospace">totalGross</span> of each moview within the time range.
                    Hint:

                    <li>
                        Use <span class="monospace"> <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-scale">invert</a></span> function
                        of the x scale to get the day value of the beginning and end of the brush selection

                    <li>
                        You can use <span class="monospace">interpolateLine</span> function to the estimated <span
                            class="monospace">totalGross</span> at the beginning and end of the selected time range.

        <h3>Trees</h3>
        <p>
            In the lecture, we're having a look at icicle plots and treemaps as two common ways to visualize tree
            structures.
            The data we're going to work with is a hierarchy of movie franchises that is created in the file <span
                class="monospace">franchises.js</span>.
            The function returns an object with the property <span class="monospace">name</span> and <span
                class="monospace">children</span> which again holds
            similar objects up to the leaves which are movie objects as seen before.
            Some of these franchises are only a group of certain movies (for example, <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>)
            whereas some also contain subgroups (for
            example,
            <i>Harry Potter</i> is subdivided into the original <i>Harry Potter</i> movies and the prequel movies
            <i>Fantastic Beasts</i>).
            The franchise data is also printed to the console for you to inspect its structure.

                <h3>Task 2: Icicle map (50%)</h3>
                <p>
                    Implement an icicle map in <span class="monospace">icicle.js</span> using the data that we have
                    prepared for you in <span class="monospace">franchises.js</span>.

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Define the hierarchy for the data. For this, you should use <a
                            href="https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy#hierarchy"><span
                                class="monospace">d3.hierarchy</span></a>
                        to create a hierarchical data structure.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Define the partition layout for the icicle map as the <span class="monospace">root</span>
                        variable. For this, you should use <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy#partition"><span
                                class="monospace">d3.partition</span></a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Define the maximum depth of the hierarchy/icicle map. This allows you to find an appropriate
                        horizontal scalling and therefore width of each rectangle node.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create the rectangle denoting the movies and their grouping.Label each rectangle with the title
                        or franchise name and the sum of their revenue. If the rectangle is too small to fit the text,
                        do not show the text label!
                    </li>

                </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hint:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        When creating the hierarchy, you have to set the <a
                            href="https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy#node_sum"><span class="monospace">sum
                                function</span></a> to sum up the
                        revenue values for each movie or franchise node in the hierarchy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Since the depth of the hierarchy or in this case, the width of the icicle map does not
                        correspond to any numerical attribute of the data, it makes more sense to use a <a
                            href="https://github.com/d3/d3-scale"><span class="monospace">scaleBand</span></a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A helper function <span class="monospace">fontSize</span> is provided to you in <span
                            class="monospace">icicle.js</span> to calculate the font size for the labels according to
                        the size of the rectangles. But only use it if the rectangle is big enough to fit the text.
                        Therefore, filter the data when you are setting up the text label in the <span
                            class="monospace">text</span> variable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Helper function <span class="monospace">shortenText</span> and <span
                            class="monospace">bigMoneyFormat</span> are provided to you in <span
                            class="monospace">utils.js</span> to make the label more readable.
                    </li>

                </ol>
