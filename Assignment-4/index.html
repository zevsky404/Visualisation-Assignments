            <h3>Theory Recap</h3>

            <p>
                In the lecture, we have introduced basic visual analytics concepts on what certain visualizations can be
                used for and how it works. In this task below, you have to find out which of the given visualizations
                are
                suitable for the given tasks or action-target pairs.
            </p>

            <div class="task">
                <h3>Task 1: Action - Target Pairs (10%)</h3>
                <p>
                    Match the following visualizations techniques to the given action-target pairs. Draw the line
                    between the each technique and the corresponding action-target pair. For that, use the
                    <code>answerQ1</code>
                    function in the <code>theory.js</code>.

            <h3>Treemaps</h3>
            <p>
                Previously, we introduced some visualization techniques for hierarchically structured data
                like icicle maps. Another common way to visualize a hierarchical dataset is treemaps. Building treemaps
                involve a usage of tiling algorithms. One of them is widely used and introduced in Lecture 7, namely
                Slice and Dice algorithm. Before implementation, you have to understand how the algorithm work on a
                simple data structure.
            </p>

            <div class="task">
                <h3>Task 2: Slice and Dice Algorithm (20%)</h3>
                <p>
                    Given the following hierarchy, visualize the treemap using the Slice and Dice algorithm. You can use
                    any drawing tool you like or draw by hand the resulting treemaps. Take a scan/photo of your solution
                    and add it below.
                </p>
            </div>

            <figure>

                <figcaption>Your solution here.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Next task requires you to create a treemap using the Slice and Dice algorithm.
                For that, the data we're going to work with is a hierarchy of movie franchises that is created in the
                file <code>franchises.js</code> just like the previous assignment.
            </p>

                <h3>Task 3: Treemap Implementation (30%)</h3>
                <p>
                    Implement the missing parts of the treemap implementation in the <code>treemap.js</code>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hints:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The code for the treemap layout has little differences from the implementation of the icicle
                        layout. You can definitely take inspiration from that.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use the right <code>tile</code> option for the layout!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When you define the <code>root</code> variable, the sum of franchise members' revenue needs to
                        be
                        calculated.
                    </li>

            <h3>Word Clouds</h3>
            <p>
                Text visualizations became more popular with the growing amounts
                of digitized, textual data. These kinds of visualizations explain
                relations between textual entities, abstract and summarize text passages
                and aim for giving users information about the text to help them find
                relevant text passages more quickly.
            </p>
            <p>A Word Cloud is a nice, yet imprecise way to have a look at the textual contents
                of our data. To get an overview of the movies in our movie database, we will create
                one Word Cloud per genre based on the movie descriptions.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a first step, you will implement the word cloud using the library <a
                    href="https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud">d3-cloud</a>.
                An example
                of how to use it can be found on <a
                    href="https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/wordcloud_basic.html">D3-graph Gallery</a>.
                As always, you are not allowed to copy the function, but you can take inspiration from
                it and adapt it to your needs. The library is already included in the <code>wordcloud.js</code>.
            </p>

            <div class="task">
                <h3>Task 4: Word Cloud Implementation (40%)</h3>
                <p>Implement the missing parts of the word cloud implementation in the <code>wordcloud.js</code>.
                    Your implementation will automatically be feed with the movie data given in the
                    <code>index.js</code>. The selection drop down menu is already implemented for you. It contains all
                    the genres/group of movies in the dataset. The word cloud should be updated when the selection is
                    changed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hints:
                <ul>
                    <li>Define the <code>layout</code> variable using the <code>cloud</code> function from the
                        <code>d3-cloud</code>library.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The update function is already defined for you. It is responsible to update the word cloud
                        layout at the start and when the genre selection is changed. Hence, you need to change the words
                        inside the layout with the new 100 most frequent words of the selected genre/group.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <code>draw</code> function is also already defined for you. It is responsible to draw the
                        word cloud layout. It takes an array-like parameter <code>words</code> which is passed
                        implicitly when the <code>draw</code> function is called on the <code>end</code> of the
                        <code>layout</code> at which new list of 100 most frequent words should already be updated.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Calling the <code>draw</code> function at the end of the
                        <code>layout</code> will ensure that the word cloud is drawn after the layout is finished.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To implement the <code>draw</code> function, you need to create a <code>text</code> element for
                        every word in the <code>words</code> parameter. Since the update is called every time the genre
                        selection is changed, you need to remove the previous <code>text</code> elements before creating
                        new ones. To do so, you have to use <code>join</code> function instead of <code>enter</code> and
                        <code>append</code> functions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The font size you are using for the word cloud depends on the frequency of the word. The more a
                        word is frequent, the bigger the font size should be. The frequency is already calculated for
                        you using <code>wordsPerGroup</code> helping function and can be accessed using the
                        <code>size</code> attribute of the word object.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
